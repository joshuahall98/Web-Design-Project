You have no memory of how you got to the clearing or why you might be in the clearing. You look around hoping to find something that might give you a clue as to where you are, but unfortunately the area is completely new to you. You notice an unatural light seeping through a gap in the trees, you decide there is only one thing to do!</p></center>
