			<center><p>You enter the clearing again but this time you are not alone. In the middle of the clearing, standing proud and beautiful, is a stag. You are wary and unaware if this creature is the 'friend' Alfryda was talking about. The stag notices you and with it's head it gestures for you to come forward, at least, it looked like that's what it did. You approach the animal but as you get closer it turns and leaves through a gap in the trees. You decide that this animal must be the friend Alfryda mentioned and follow it.</p></center>
