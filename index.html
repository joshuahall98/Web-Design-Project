				<center><p>This is a choose your own path game, you are given options and you choose what you wish to do. Character stats and all items and spells obtained must be kept track of by the player, for example: Writing it down onto a sheet of paper. The player has a bag that can only hold up to ten items, if you have ten items and wish to obtain a new one, dispose of one of your bagged items. It is recommended that you draw up a map/layout of the game so that you can play multiple times and tryout different ways of completing the game.</p></center>

				<center><h2>Combat</h2></center>
				<center><p>At the beginning of a fight, Roll a dice to see who attacks first, once for yourself, then your enemy. The highest role goes first, in the case of equal rolls, you attack first. The fight continues until one character runs out of HP (Hit points). Each turn (after the first turn) the person who rolled the highest at the beginning attacks first. Losing a fight (Your HP=0) results in restarting the game, unless stated otherwise. Spells can only be used in combat unless otherwise stated. All characters can use spells although only the Mage has increased spell damage. Damage is dealt by rolling the dice and  taking the number a character obtained and adding it onto a character's Attack or Magic power (This occurs every turn), the total score is taken from the oposing characters HP and thus damage is dealt. When using a spell select a spell from the spells you have obtained and follow the instructions. The Mage starts with a basic damage spell and it has no added effects. All HP is restored after combat. You cannot run from a fight unless there is an option to do so. Cannot cast a spell and use a normal attack on the same turn. Cannot cast the same spell two turns in a row.</p><center>

			<div class="rulesdiv5">
				<center><h2>Luck</h2></center>
				<center><p>The luck stat states how many numbers you can choose (On the dice) when in a luck situation, if the chosen number(s) is rolled you are lucky, otherwise you are unlucky. During combat if you are 'Lucky' the option you are rolling for is a success and whatever is stated can be done. Outside of combat the rules can change, if so follow what is stated.</p><center>
