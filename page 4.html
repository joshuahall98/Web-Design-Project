			<center><h1>The Light Source</h1></center>
			<center><p>You leave the clearing and head towards the light source, squeezing through a gap inbetween the trees. You find yourself in front of a small pool, realisation dawns on you that this is what is emitting the strange source of light. You decide to take a closer look at the pool. It is not deep, you could wade though it with it barely rising above your knees. You can clearly see the bottom of the pool and your reflection in the water. After staring at your reflection for a moment you notice that it begins to look less and less like you, eventually it doesn't look like you at all. The water around the face that was yours begins to shimmer and gradually the form of a woman rises from the surface of the pool. You stare in shock as the woman turns around, glides to the centre of the pool and turns to face you. You stare at the woman of the pool, awestruck by her beauty. Before you get the chance to take in everything you are seeing the woman speaks to you.</p><center>
			<center><p>"Greetings adventurer, I am guessing you are wondering why I have brought you here, in fact, you are probably wondering where 'here' is, I will tell you. My name is Alfryda, I am the ruler of the fairy people of this world. I have summoned you here to our world, the land of Gildran, because a Great Evil threatens the existence of our world. You may ask why I chose you adventurer, why I dragged you from your world to ours, if I'm honest, I did not choose you, I summoned a hero with the power to defeat the great evil and a force unknown to I, chose you."</p></center>
			<center><p>You try to explain to Alfryda that in the world you came from you aren't a hero, at least not the type of hero she is looking for, that in your world 'Great Evil' is only ever spoken of in stories and myth. Alfryda does not listen though, she says that you would not have appeared before her if you weren't what her world needed.</p></center>
