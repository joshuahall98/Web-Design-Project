			<center><h1>Follow The Stag</h1></center>
			<center><p>The stag does not wait for you but races off through the woods, you immediatly pick up your pace and do your best to keep up with the stag but it is a struggle. You dodge and weave through branches and bushes, you almost trip and fall a few times but you never let the stag go out of site. As you pass alongside a small river the stag takes a quick turn just past the entrance of a cave. You pick up speed to make sure the stag doesn't disappear but suddenly a creature rises from inside the cave. You are stopped in your tracks and stare up at the giant creature making it's way out of the cave, it's fur dirty and matted. The creature stands up to a height of around 10 feet and stares down at you. You could tell he wasn't here to give you a hug.</p></center>
