			<center><p>You are the defintion of a dry shite. Look at you, why did you even press the start game button? Here you are choosing to play this game yet the first thing you do is be a complete and utter little bitch and not even explore the weird light source, you are just a complete waste of space. You know what? we'll continue the story from here. "You sat alone in the clearing wondering why you were the most boring person in existence, actually stuggling to figure out what was wrong with yourself, when suddenly, you choked on nothing and your useless life was ended". There, I'm more content now that you chose this option, this is what you deserve!</p></center>
