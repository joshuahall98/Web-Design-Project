You now realise the power that Alfryda gave you, you would never have been able to fight and kill a creature like that back in your own world. You stop and admire this new power you have been given but it is short lived, you remember the stag and quickly head round the side of the cave. You keep running in what seems to be a straight enough path, hoping the stag may have stopped up ahead to wait for you. Unfortunately your hope in finding the stag drops, you come to a stand still in front of a fork in the forest path. You see no markings on the ground to elude to which way the stag may have gone and realise from here on in, you're making your own decisions...</p></center>
