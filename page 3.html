			<center><p>You awake not knowing where you are. You find yourself in a clearing in the middle of a forest. The trees tower above you and the sunlight struggles to pierce the thick canopy. You have no memory of how you got to the clearing or why you might be in the clearing. You look around hoping to find something that might give you a clue as to where you are, but unfortunately the area is completely new to you. You notice an unatural light seeping through a gap in the trees, you decide there is only one thing to do!</p></center>
